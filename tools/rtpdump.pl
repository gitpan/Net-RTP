=head1 NAME

rtpdump.pl - Parse and display incoming RTP packet headers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rtpdump.pl <address> [<port>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rtpdump.pl displays the RTP header of packets sent to a multicast group.
If no port is specified, then port 5004 is assumed.

For each packet recieved, the following fields are displayed:

=over

=item

B<COUNT> - the number of packets recieved.

=item

B<SRC> - the source IP address and port.

=item

B<LEN> - the length of the payload (in bytes).

=item

B<PT> - the payload type number.

=item

B<SSRC> - the source indentifier unique to this session.

=item

B<SEQ> - the packet's contiguous sequence number.

=item

B<TIME> - the packet's timestamp (based on payload clock rate).

=item

B<MARK> - displayed if the packet's marker bit is set.

multicast group.
